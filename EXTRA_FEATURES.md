# ðŸš€ **Extra Features Beyond Requirements**

This document outlines all the **additional features and enhancements** implemented beyond the basic requirements specified in `requirement.md`.

## Basic Requirements

- Single page chat application
- Username selection (3 users)
- Channel selection (3 channels)
- Latest messages display
- "Read more" button
- Basic error handling for unsent messages
- Text editor persistence on page reload

---

## EXTRA Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced localStorage Persistence

- âœ… **Message drafts** persist per channel (type in General, switch to LGTM, come back - text still there)
- âœ… **User profile selection** persists across sessions (close browser, reopen - same user selected)
- âœ… **Channel selection** persists across sessions (remembers last visited channel)
- âœ… **Error messages** persist failed messages (close browser, reopen and can be resent)

### 2. Error Handling & Recovery

- âœ… **Resend button** for failed messages
- âœ… **Undo Send button** to remove error messages
- âœ… **Error persistence** across browser sessions
- âœ… **Optimistic UI updates** with rollback on error

**User Experience:**

1. Message fails â†’ Shows with error icon + "Resend" + "Undo Send" buttons
2. User can retry or dismiss the error
3. Error messages persist even after browser restart

### 3. Comprehensive Testing (89% Coverage)

- âœ… **Unit tests** for main components and hooks.
- âœ… **Integration tests** testing message render, switch channel, send message success, send message error.
- âœ… **Mock GraphQL API** testing with success/failure scenarios
- âœ… **Co-located tests** with components for better organization
- âœ… **GitHub Actions CI/CD** pipeline
- âœ… **Automated testing** on pull requests with coverage reporting

### 4. âš¡ Optimistic Updates & Loading States

**UX enhancement**

- âœ… **Instant message display** on send with loading spinner
- âœ… **Status progression:** Loading â†’ Success/Error icons
- âœ… **Beautiful skeleton loading** that matches actual message layout

### **5. UX improvement & Interaction**

- âœ… **Enter key to send** messages
- âœ… **Shift+Enter for multiline** messages (like Slack/Discord)
- âœ… **Auto-focus** input after sending (seamless typing flow)
- âœ… **Form validation** (prevent empty messages)

**Interaction Flow:**

1. Type message â†’ Press Enter â†’ Message sends â†’ Input stays focused
2. Type message â†’ Press Shift+Enter â†’ New line added
3. Click Send â†’ Same behavior as Enter

### 6. Code Quality

- âœ… **Custom React hooks** (`useChatState`, `useLocalStorage`)
- âœ… **React Context** for global state management
- âœ… **Modular component architecture** with clear separation
- âœ… **TypeScript throughout** with proper types and interfaces
- âœ… **ESLint configuration** for code quality enforcement
- âœ… **Reusable UI components** (Avatar, Icon, Button, TextInput, SelectInput)

### 7. Folder Structure

A well-organized folder structure is crucial for maintainability, scalability, and team collaboration. The chosen architecture follows modern React best practices with clear separation of concerns.

**Design Philosophy:**

- **Feature-based organization** for better code discoverability
- **Separation of concerns** between generic and specific components
- **Scalability** that supports future feature additions

**Architecture Breakdown:**

1. **`pages/`** - Page-specific components following Next.js conventions

   - Contains components that are unique to specific pages
   - Includes page-level state and routing logic
   - Uses `_components/` subfolder to separate page logic from component implementation
   - **Why `_components/`?** This pattern helps maintain clean separation where:
     - `page.tsx` focuses on high-level layout and state management
     - `_components/` contains the detailed component implementations
     - Developers can quickly understand the page structure by reading just `page.tsx`
     - Component complexity is hidden in the subfolder, improving code readability
   - Example: `pages/chat/page.tsx`, `pages/chat/_components/ChatPanel/`

2. **`modules/`** - Feature-based modules for business logic

   - Encapsulates all code related to a specific feature/domain
   - Reusable across multiple pages that need the same functionality
   - Example: `modules/chat/` contains hooks, components, context for chat functionality

3. **`ui/`** - Generic, reusable UI components

   - Design system components that can be used anywhere
   - No business logic, purely presentational
   - Example: `Button.tsx`, `TextInput.tsx`, `Avatar.tsx`

4. **`lib/`** - Utility functions and generic hooks

   - Shared utilities and helper functions
   - Custom hooks that aren't feature-specific
   - Example: `useLocalStorage.ts`, `cn.ts` (className utility)

5. **`gql/`** - GraphQL generated code and operations
   - Auto-generated types and hooks from GraphQL CodeGen
   - Centralized location for all API-related code
   - Example: Generated types, query/mutation hooks

**Architecture Patterns:**

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ modules/chat/          # Feature-based organization
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/        # Chat-specific components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/            # Custom business logic hooks
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ context/          # React Context for state
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ gql/              # GraphQL operations
â”œâ”€â”€ ui/                   # Reusable UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/                  # Utility functions and hooks
â””â”€â”€ pages/                # Page-level components
```
